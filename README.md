# Party Task Planner

## New Technologies

In this app I want to try a bunch of new things:
- [x] Vercel for frontend hosting
- [x] Automated releases with github actions
- [x] Appsync javascript resolvers
- [ ] Appsync subscriptions for real-time updates everywhere
- [ ] Playwright frontend tests
- [ ] HTMX instead of react & apollo

## DX Notes

- Even though I can get nice types, the whole thing should be much easier
- Isnt there a service out there which I can just give my graphql schema and it will provision the
  api? the cdk setup including CI/CD seems kind of big for a relatively simple thing
- Trying a bunch of new technologies while trying to be fast at the same time is
  contradictory. For speed it might be better to use a known tool to reduce complexity instead of
  getting familiar with many new things

## CI/CD

Vercel provides CI/CD jobs out of the box. Played around with overriding the jobs
(https://vercel.com/guides/how-can-i-use-github-actions-with-vercel) before finding out these jobs
can be customized in the vercel project settings (not a file in this repo).

## SSR

Because I am using localstorage to store the username, nextjs goes crazy:
https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-hydration-error

Should I use more SSR for my app?

## GraphQL Schema

- Would be nice to have an auto-increment id for the participants
- Is it annoying that the participants have the partyId as the PK? Maybe in some hypothetical
  support cases, but there could be work-arounds for these
